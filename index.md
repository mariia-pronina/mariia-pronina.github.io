Hello, I am Mariia (Marusia) Pronina. I have a PhD in Language Sciences and I am postdoc Juan de la Cierva at the University of the Balearic Islands (UIB).

I am interested in the role of multimodal cues — prosody and gestures — in communication from a developmental and cognitive perspective. My research mainly focuses on first language acquisition. I study how the social and cognitive forces shape pragmatic and prosodic development. I am interested in bi- and multilingualism and the maintenance of heritage (migrant minority) languages.

I defended my PhD at the University Pompeu Fabra in Dr. Pilar Prieto's lab (Group of Prosodic and Gesture Studies). Now I am doing my postdoc at the University of the Balearic Islands under the supervision of Maria del Mar Vanrell.
